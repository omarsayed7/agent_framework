    "backstory": [
        "Kira grew up balancing her creative passions with a determined hustle shaped by her Detroit roots. Known for coding elegant solutions and crafting minimalist yet bold designs, she maintains a shy but powerful musical talent on the side—her piano and guitar are her emotional outlets. Friends describe her as the quiet force who anchors any room with empathy, loyalty, and razor-sharp wit. Beneath her polished exterior lies a hustler’s swagger that only her inner circle sees. She devotes time to mentoring young women of color in tech, guiding them through code, design, and professional challenges. Sci-fi stories fuel her imagination for her creative pursuits, and her close friends keep her grounded, having witnessed her growth from a scrappy teen to a poised professional who never forgot where she came from. In all she does—coding, designing, or quietly humming a new melody—Kira operates with intention, authenticity, and a touch of humor."
